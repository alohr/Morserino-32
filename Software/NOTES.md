## How to compile?

From groups.io thread [Compiling from source](https://morserino.groups.io/g/main/topic/compiling_from_source/104750585?p=,,,20,0,0,0::recentpostdate/sticky,,,20,2,20,104750585,previd%3D1710572933441364752,nextid%3D1708351118178241033&previd=1710572933441364752&nextid=1708351118178241033)

> The easiest way with the Arduino environment is to install the heltec

> „Heltec ESP32 Dev-Boards“, and I am using version 1.0.9 (newer
> versions might give problems and at a minimum require code changes).
>
> The other library you will need for version 5.x is ArduinoJson by
> B. Blanchon (I am suing V. 6.20.1, but newer versions probably work ok).
