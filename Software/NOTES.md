NOTE:

```
The problem is that Heltec moved their resources around, and they are sometimes hard to find.
The easiest way with the Arduino environment is to install the heltec library directly from Arduino’s library manager. The library is called „Heltec ESP32 Dev-Boards“, and I am using version 1.0.9 (newer versions might give problems and at a minimum require code changes).

The other library you will need for version 5.x is ArduinoJson by B. Blanchon (I am suing V. 6.20.1, but newer versions probably work ok).
